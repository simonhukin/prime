Coding Challenge 


Objective:

We want you to produce a single page app to produce
multiplication tables of prime numbers.

It must to default to 10 primes.
It needs to take input in order for the end-user to input any
numeric argument (maybe we want to see 20/30/40+ primes).

Across the top and down the left side should be the prime
numbers, and the body of the table should contain the product
of multiplying those numbers.

If the number of primes is greater than will comfortably
display a table on screen, default to just printing the ‘n’th
prime number and a message explaining the size is too great to
display a table. i.e. if the user inputs 50000, just print the
50,000th prime and a message. Use your discretion in deciding
how big is too big.


Notes:

- Consider Code complexity.
- Consider cases where we want more than ‘n’ primes (What
if we just wanted to generate the 65,000
th prime number?)
- Consider KISS and not over-engineering
- Consider re-usability
- DO NOT use a library method for calculating the prime
(write your own).
- Use Tests. TDD/BDD. Cannot stress tests enough!
- Impress us.
